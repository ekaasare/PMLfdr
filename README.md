# PMLfdr: Poisson GLM Mixture for Testing Significant Features in HTS Data

## âœ¨ Overview

`PMLfdr` provides flexible tools for modeling and multiple testing procedures, including Poisson GLM mixture models and local false discovery rate (Lfdr) approaches, tailored for large-scale HTS data.

This package was developed to address challenges such as overdispersion, small sample sizes, and inefficient control of error rates.
